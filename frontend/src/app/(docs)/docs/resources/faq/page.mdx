# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about Mantle Gasless Relayer.

## General Questions

### What is a Paymaster?

A Paymaster is a smart contract that sponsors gas fees for your users' transactions. When a user interacts with your dApp, the Paymaster pays for the transaction gas using its funded balance, making the experience completely gasless for your users.

### Is this only for Mantle Network?

Currently, Mantle Gasless Relayer is designed specifically for Mantle Network (and Mantle Sepolia testnet). The smart contracts are deployed and optimized for Mantle's architecture.

### How much does it cost?

Mantle Gasless Relayer is free to use on testnet. On mainnet, you only pay for the actual gas consumed by sponsored transactions. There are no additional fees or subscriptions.

## Technical Questions

### How does EIP-712 signing work?

EIP-712 provides a standard for typed structured data signing. Instead of signing raw transaction data, users sign a human-readable message that includes all transaction details. This signature is then used by the relayer to execute the transaction on the user's behalf.

EIP-712 signatures show users exactly what they're signing in a readable format, improving security and trust.
</Callout>

### What happens if my Paymaster runs out of funds?

If your Paymaster's balance falls below the required amount for a transaction, the transaction will fail. Users will see an error message, and you'll receive a notification (if configured). We recommend setting up balance alerts in the dashboard.

### Can I whitelist specific functions?

Yes! You can whitelist specific contracts and even specific functions within those contracts. This gives you granular control over which user actions your Paymaster will sponsor.

### How do I prevent abuse?

Several mechanisms help prevent abuse:

1. **Contract whitelisting** - Only sponsor transactions to approved contracts
2. **Function whitelisting** - Only sponsor specific functions
3. **Spending limits** - Set daily/monthly gas spending caps
4. **Rate limiting** - The relayer includes built-in rate limiting

## SDK Questions

### Which frameworks are supported?

The SDK is framework-agnostic and works with:
- React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte
- Node.js backend applications
- Any JavaScript/TypeScript environment
- Mobile apps via React Native

### Can I use the SDK without a wallet library?

The SDK works best with wallet libraries like wagmi, ethers.js, or viem, as it needs to request EIP-712 signatures from users. However, you can integrate with any signing mechanism.

### Is there a React hook?

Yes! The SDK includes React hooks for easy integration:

```typescript
import { useMantleRelayer } from '@mantle-relayer/sdk/react';

function Component() {
  const { sendTransaction, isLoading } = useMantleRelayer();
  // ...
}
```

## Security Questions

### Are my funds safe in a Paymaster?

Yes, only you (the owner) can withdraw funds from your Paymaster. The relayer can only use funds to pay for approved transactions.

### What if the relayer goes down?

Your funds remain safe in your Paymaster smart contract. You can always withdraw directly from the contract, even if the relayer service is unavailable.

### Is the code open source?

Yes, all smart contracts are open source and verified on block explorers. The SDK is also open source.
