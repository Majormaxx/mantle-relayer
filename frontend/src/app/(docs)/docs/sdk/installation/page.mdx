# SDK Installation

Install and configure the Mantle Relayer SDK in your project.

## Package Installation

### npm

```bash
npm install @mantle-relayer/sdk
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn add @mantle-relayer/sdk
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm add @mantle-relayer/sdk
```

## Peer Dependencies

The SDK requires viem as a peer dependency:

```bash
npm install viem@^2.0.0
```

## TypeScript Support

The SDK is written in TypeScript and includes full type definitions. No additional `@types` packages are needed.

### Minimum TypeScript Version

TypeScript 5.0 or higher is recommended.

### tsconfig.json

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "target": "ES2020",
    "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM"]
  }
}
```

## Bundle Size

The SDK is tree-shakeable. Only import what you need:

```typescript
// ✅ Good - only imports what's used
import { RelayerClient } from '@mantle-relayer/sdk';

// ❌ Avoid - imports everything
import * as SDK from '@mantle-relayer/sdk';
```

## Browser Support

The SDK supports all modern browsers:

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 90+
- Safari 15+
- Edge 90+

## Node.js Support
